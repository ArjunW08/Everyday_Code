/*
 * Java Collection Framework :
 * Provides a set of interfaces and classes to implement various data strutures and algorithms.
 * These interfaces include several methods to perform different operations on collections.
 * 
 * Collection -> List, Set, Queue
 * Map -> SorterdMap
 * Iterator -> ListIterator
 * 
 * List
 * Set -> SortedSet
 * Queue -> Deque
 * 
 * All above mentioned are interfaces. This whole set is called as collection framework.
 * 
 * Java Collection Interface :
 * It contains various ethods that can be used to perform different operations on objects.
 * 1. size()
 * 2. isEmpty()
 * 3. contains(Object O)
 * 4. add(E e)
 * 5. remove(Object O)
 * 6. containsAll(Collection<> C)
 * 7. addAll(Coellection<> C)
 * 8. removeAll(Collection<> C)
 * 9. retainALL(Collection<> C)
 * 10. clear()
 * 11. Object[] toArray()
 * 
 * Java List Interface : 
 * The List interface extends the collection interface and adds methods that are specific
 * to lists, which are ordered collections that allow duplicate elements.
 * Here are some methods that are present in the list interface but not in the 
 * Collection inerface.
