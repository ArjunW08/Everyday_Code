/*
 * Java Inheritance : Inheritance is one of the key features of OOP that allows us to create a new class from an existing class.
 * The new class that is created is known as subclass(child or derived class) and the existing class from where the child class is derived is known as superclass
 * (parent or base class).
 * 
 * Method Overriding :
 * If a subclass provides the specific implemetation of the method that has been declared by one of its parent class, it is known as 
 * method overriding.
 * Method overriding is also known as runtime polymorphism. Hence, we can achieve Ploymorphism in Java
 * with the help of Inheritance.
 * 
 * Types of Inheritance : 
 * 1. Multilevel Inheritance(Chaining)
 * 2. Heirachical Inheritance
 * 
 * Super Keyword : 
 * super is a special keyword in Java that is used to refer to the instance of the immediate parent class.
 * 
 * Uses of super Keyword in Java
 * It is used to invoke a method of the immediate parent class.
 * It is used to invoke a constructor of the immediate parent class.
 * 
 * This is a current object but super is not an object.
 * 
 * Final Keyword : 
 * It is a non access modifier keyword which can never be changed in future.
 * It can be final variable, class or method.
 * Variable with final keyword cannot be assigned again.
 * Method with final keyword cannot be overridden by its subclass.
 * Class with final keywords cannot be extended or inherited from other classes.
