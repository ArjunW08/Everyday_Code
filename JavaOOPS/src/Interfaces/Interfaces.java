/*
 * Java Intefaces : 
 * An interface is a fully abstract class. It includes a group of abstract methods.
 * We use the interface keyword to create an interface in Java.
 * 
 * Like abstract classes, we cannot create objects of interfaces.
 * To use an interface, other classes must implement it. We use implements keyword to 
 * implement an interface. 
 * 
 * We can implement multiple interfaces in a single class.
 * 
 * Adv : 
 * 1. Similar to abstract classes, interfaces help us to achieve abstraction in Java.
 * 2. Interfaces are also used to achieve multiple inheritance in Java.
 * Note : All the methods inside an interface are implicitly public and all fields
 * are implicitly public static final.
