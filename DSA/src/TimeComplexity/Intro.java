package TimeComplexity;

/*
 * Time taken by an algorithm as a function of the
 * length of inputs.
 * 
 * Big O Notation
 * We have to find upper bound and ignore 
 * smaller bounds and constants.
 * 
 * Tree Method to find time complexity : 
 * Ex: From function we can create a equation like this 
 * T(n) =  2T(n/2) + nc and calculate the height of tree.
 * 
 * 10^8 Operations rule : 
 * Length(N)            Time Complexity
 * <=[10-11]            O(n!), O(n^6)
 * <=[15-18]            O(2^n x n^2)
 * <100                 O(n^4)
 * <400                 O(n^3)
 * <2000                O(n^2 x log n)
 * <10^4                O(n^2)
 * <10^6                O(n x log n)
 * <10^8                O(n), O(log n)
